Hello! I'm Caleb.


I'm an electrical engineer at [LGS Labs at CACI](https://www.caci.com/) in Florham Park, NJ, where I work in digital signal processing and software development.
I graduated from the [Cooper Union](https://cooper.edu/) with a B.E. and M.E. in electrical engineering.

In my free time I work on various [side projects](/projects).
I'm also an [amateur landscape and wildlife photographer](https://portfolio.calebzulawski.com).

I've been a member of the [Rust Portable SIMD Project Group](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/09/29/Portable-SIMD-PG.html) since September 2020.
Our charter is to create the `std::simd` module for the Rust programming language's standard library, providing a safe, easy, and portable abstraction for using [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD).
We are currently in the process of stabilizing the project for inclusion in the nightly compiler.

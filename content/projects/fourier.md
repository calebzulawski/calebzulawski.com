The Fourier transform is a fundamental tool for digital signal processing.
`Fourier` is my attempt at creating a small, simple, yet state-of-the-art Fourier transform implementation.
For some transform sizes it is competitive with the best implementations, but there is still room for improvement for powers of two.
`Fourier` is written in Rust but also supports C and C++.
